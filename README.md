# Instagram Followers Checker

A simple command-line script to check who isn't following you back on Instagram.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- An Instagram account

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or just install instaloader directly:

```bash
pip install instaloader
```

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python instagram_followers_checker.py
```

You'll be prompted for:

- Your Instagram username
- Your password (typing will be hidden)

## How it works

The script will:

1. Log into your Instagram account.
2. Fetch your followers list.
3. Fetch your following list.
4. Compare them to find out:
   - Who you follow that doesn't follow you back.
   - Who follows you that you don't follow back.
5. Save the results to a text file with a timestamp.

## Notes

- **2FA**: If you use two-factor authentication, you might need to generate an app password or disable 2FA temporarily.
- **Rate limiting**: Instagram limits API requests. For larger accounts, the script might take a couple of minutes to finish.
- **Security**: Do not share the session files generated by instaloader (they are saved in the current folder).
- **Privacy**: Your password is only used for authentication and is never saved.

## Security

- Password input is hidden.
- Credentials are not stored anywhere.
- Instaloader creates local session files so you don't have to log in on every run.

## Output

Results are printed to the terminal and saved locally in:

```
instagram_check_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication error:**

- Check your credentials.
- Handle 2FA if it's enabled.
- If Instagram requires additional verification, log in via your phone or browser, confirm it was you, and try again.

**Slow execution:**

- This is normal for accounts with many followers/following.
- Instagram limits the request speed to prevent spam.

**"Challenge required":**

- Instagram requires further verification.
- Log in on your phone or browser, complete the challenge, and run the script again.
